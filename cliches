Not gonna lie
I can't lie
All my eggs in one basket
I'm over it
Two faced
Playing a game
I gotta stay true to myself
I'm not going to be in a triangle
Out of order
I'm getting the ick
He's giving me the ick
I've got the ick
Wanna go for a chat?
I've got a text!
It's early days
To be fair
I'm livid
How ya feeling?
Where's your head at?
What ya thinking?
Work out where my head is at
I'm not here for drama
I don't want any drama
I'm not interested in games
Goin' on a date
She's fit
He's fit
Oh my dayz
My head is scrambled
I'm open to getting to know other people
I've never felt this way before
I didn't think I would feel like this about someone so quickly
It'll take a lot for my head to turn
Do you know what I mean?
I get where you're coming from
Today's a new day
Gotta back myself
Gotta back yourself
100 Percent
You're trouble
Gave me fanny flutters
I owe it to myself
It is what it is
